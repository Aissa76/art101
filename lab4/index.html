			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was challenging breaking down battle ship in to high level tasts and sub dividing them. We just took our time in really thinking about how it works.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went well for us. I feel like I am getting better and more confident every time I code.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You are looking at the index.html file I created. It is a list of high level tasks for changing a bike tire:</p>
					<h2>Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
					<div class = "code"></div>
					 <pre>
Changing a bike tire:

prepare
    Move to workspace		
Remove wheel
Remove tire
Extract and inspect innertube
Install new tube or patch hole
Reset innertube and tire
inflate
Reinstall wheel
						</pre>
						<p>Here is my pseudocode for a batttleship game, where a player plays against the computor:</p>
						<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
						 <pre>
//set the board 
	//create game boards for both player and computer
	//player places 3 ships randomly on board
	//computer places 3 ships randomly on board
//play the game 
	//repeat until one player loses all ships
	//players turn
		//display computer board (only show hits/misses, not ship locations)
		//ask player to enter target coordinates (e.g., B3)
		//accept user input (guess) coords 
		//check if shot is a hit or miss
			//if hit → mark board, decrease computer’s ship count if sunk
			//if miss → mark board
	//computers turn 
		//randomly select target coordinates not already used
		//check if shot is a hit or miss
			//if hit → mark board, decrease players ship count if sunk
			//if miss → mark board
			//if hit all spots of ship → display ship on board
//end game
	//if player has 0 ships → display "You Lost!"
	//if computer has 0 ships → display "You Won!"
	//ask player to play again
