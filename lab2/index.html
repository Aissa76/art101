			<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>My name is Aissa and this is my first time programing. I am struggling a little bit but when I make a break though it is really rewarding! This makes me eager to learn more. I am also excited to see how JS plays a role in my webpage. I worked with Rhys on this assignment. We worked together but created separate webpages. I feel that this helped us oth build a stronger undrstanding of the code we wrote. </p>
